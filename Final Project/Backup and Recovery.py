# Prompt user for username and password

# Verify the username and password against a secure authentication system
# If the username and password are valid, proceed with the backup process
# If the username and password are invalid, prompt the user to re-enter them
# If the user fails to enter valid credentials after a certain number of attempts, exit the script


# Prompt the user if they want to perform a backup or restore
# If the user chooses to perform a backup, proceed with the backup process
# If the user chooses to perform a restore, proceed with the restore process
# If the user chooses to exit, exit the script

#Define logging destionation path and log file name for backup and restore process logs

# BACKUP PROCESS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prompt the user for the backup destination and the user directory to be backed up

# Verify the backup destination against a secure authentication system
# If the backup destination is valid, proceed with the backup process
# If the backup destination is invalid, exit the script


# Prompt the user for scheduled backup time and frequency

# Validate the scheduled backup time and frequency
# If the scheduled backup time and frequency are valid, proceed with the backup process
# If the scheduled backup time and frequency are invalid, exit the script


# Define the path to the user directory to be backed up

# Recognize the folders and contents in the user directory

# Check for modification dates and do not back up files that have not been modified since the last backup

# Calculate the size of the files to be backed up


# Print the size of the files to be backed up and prompt the user for confirmation to proceed with the backup
# If the user confirms, proceed with the backup
# If the user does not confirm, exit the script


# Create a backup directory with the current date and time

#Encrypt the files to be backed up using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES)
# Use a secure key management system to store the encryption keys securely
# Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to generate a hash of the files to be backed up

# Progress indicator to show the status of the backup process
# Use a secure file transfer protocol (e.g., SFTP) to transfer the files to the backup destination
# Print a running list of the files being backed up and their sizes
# Print any errors encountered during the backup process, including files that could not be backed up
# Log the backup process, including the start and end times, the size of the files backed up, and any errors encountered during the backup process


#Print backup completion status and the location of the backup files


# General Error handling
# If the backup fails, log the error and notify the user


# RESTORE PROCESS --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prompt the user for the backup file to restore and the destination directory

# Verify the backup file against a secure authentication system
# If the backup file is valid, proceed with the restore process
# If the backup file is invalid, prompt the user to re-enter the backup file
# If the user fails to enter a valid backup file after a certain number of attempts, exit the script


#Prompt the user for the restore directory password and verify it against a secure authentication system
# If the restore directory password is valid, proceed with the restore process
# If the restore directory password is invalid, exit the script


#Start the restore process and log the start time
# Use a secure file transfer protocol (e.g., SFTP) to transfer the files from the backup destination to the restore directory
# Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of the files being restored
# Decrypt the files being restored using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES)


# Progress indicator to show the status of the restore process
# Use a secure file transfer protocol (e.g., SFTP) to transfer the files from the backup destination to the restore directory
# Print a running list of the files being restored and their sizes
# Print any errors encountered during the restore process, including files that could not be restored
# Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of the files being restored
# Log the restore process, including the start and end times, the size of the files restored, and any errors encountered during the restore process
# Print restore completion status and the location of the restored files


# General Error handling
# If the restore fails, log the error and notify the user
